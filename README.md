===========

A practice tool for guitar enthusiasts.

How is it done?
---------------
Just HTML5 and JavaScript, sir.

The TODO List:
--------------
Scaleomatic will contain modules for the following:

* Random practice picker.
* Play-along fretboard graphic showing real-time visual guidelines for the exercises.
* Audio-reference for the scales/harmonic-intervals and live play-along.
* Embeded metronome that will configure play-along speed if enabled.
* Timer for time-boxing exercises.
* Speed trainer module for the metronome, with a selectable bpm incrementor.
* Uploadable resource for public comunity exercises.
